The investigations carried out by the [Root.GetName] establish [From.GetName] to be a star made entirely of antimatter, the counterpart with opposite electric charge to the regular matter that makes up the rest of the Universe. It is probable that it formed inside an Antimatter Galaxy, and by random chance was expulsed from there and ended up in our Galaxy. The violent response of [From.GetName] to external matter comes from the fact that if any antimatter and its matter counterpart come close enough, they annihilate and produce radiation in a sizable explosion. The crew of the [Root.GetName] suggest further investigation into the matter to ascertain if it could have practical uses."
